                            <p>Confederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and addicted to morphine, also had a medical degree and began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug. In 1885 at Pemberton's Eagle Drug and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered Pemberton's French Wine Coca nerve tonic. Pemberton's tonic may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a French-Corsican coca wine, but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the beverage's source of caffeine. A Spanish drink called "Kola Coca" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953.</p>

                            <p>Fanta was created in 1940 in Germany during World War II when the German Coca-Cola bottling plant couldn't import syrup from the U.S. due to the war. Factory manager Max Keith used available ingredients like whey and apple fiber to create a new fruit-based drink. The first Fanta was yellow and had varying flavors depending on available resources. The name "Fanta" was coined during a staff competition, inspired by the word "fantasy." After production stopped following a merger, Fanta was re-launched in 1955 in response to Pepsi's competition and became widely available across Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Today, Fanta offers over 100 flavors globally, many of which are regional.</p>

                            <p>The Sprite brand name was created by T. C. "Bud" Evans, a Houston-based bottler who also distributed Coca-Cola products, circa 1955 for a line of drinks with flavors such as strawberry and orange; the rights to the name were acquired by the Coca-Cola Company in 1960.
                                The lemon-lime drink known today as Sprite was developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone ("Fanta Clear Lemon" in English) and was introduced in the United States under the Sprite name in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up.</p>

                            <p>In the late 18th century, Johann Jacob Schweppe developed a process for bottling carbonated mineral water, inspired by Joseph Priestley’s discoveries. He founded the Schweppes Company in 1783 in Geneva and later moved to London to expand. In 1843, Schweppes began selling Malvern Water, which became a favorite of the British Royal Family. In 1969, Schweppes merged with Cadbury to form Cadbury Schweppes, which split in 2008, with its U.S. beverage unit becoming Keurig Dr Pepper. Coca-Cola now owns Schweppes in several regions, while Suntory controls it in others. Schweppes’ classic products include ginger ale (1870), bitter lemon (1957), and tonic water (1871).</p>

                    <p>The Oreo is a cookie sandwich or cream biscuit. It is made by the Nabisco division of Mondelēz International. The cookie has a sweet, white filling of cream. The creme is in between two circle-shaped chocolate or golden cookie pieces.</p>

                            <p>The Oreo cookie was first produced by Nabisco in 1912 as a rival to the Hydrox cookie. The name "Oreo" was trademarked that same year. Initially sold in metal canisters, it evolved through various names, including "Oreo Sandwich" in 1921 and "Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie" in 1974. The modern design was finalized in 1952, and the filling was developed by Sam Porcello. In the 1990s, Nabisco replaced lard with vegetable oil, making Oreos kosher and suitable for vegans, though cross-contamination with dairy is possible.</p>

                    <p>Sour Patch Kids are a brand of soft candy with a coating of invert sugar and sour sugar. The tartaric and citric acids provide the candy with a sharp burst of tartness, while the inverted sugar gives the soft gummy its sweet flavor.</p>

In the late 1970s, Cadbury and the Malaco Licorice Company formed the Allen Candy Company in Hamilton, Ontario to produce them. In 1985, they were re-branded to "Sour Patch Kids." The name was likely changed to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids at the time. Mondelez International currently handles production of the candy, following their acquisition of the Allen Candy Company in the late 1990s.</p>
